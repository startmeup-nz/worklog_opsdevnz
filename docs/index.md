# worklog-opsdevnz

Configurable CLI tool for creating and managing dated development worklogs.

- **Status:** Development
- **License:** Apache 2.0
- **Python:** 3.14+

## Overview

Across multiple projects, teams kept reinventing the same pattern: a script that
creates a dated Markdown file from a template, with YAML frontmatter for date,
author, tags, and draft status. Each implementation had slightly different
directory structures, section headers, and filenames, but the core concept was
always the same.

`worklog-opsdevnz` formalises this pattern into a single reusable module.
Install it once, configure it per project, and start logging.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install (development)
uv pip install -e .

# Create today's worklog
worklog-opsdevnz

# Show version
worklog-opsdevnz --version

# Override the editor for this run
worklog-opsdevnz --editor nvim
```

## Configuration

Each project gets a `worklog.toml` at its root:

```toml
worklog_dir = "docs/worklog"
structure = "flat"           # "flat", "year", or "year-month"
filename_pattern = "{date}-{slug}.md"
author = "Your Name"
default_tags = ["worklog", "log"]

[[sections]]
title = "🎯 Focus"

[[sections]]
title = "✅ Completed"

[[sections]]
title = "🧠 Notes"

[[sections]]
title = "⏳ Next"
```

## Directory Structure

The tool supports three directory layouts, configured per project:

| Mode | Layout | Best For |
|------|--------|----------|
| `flat` | `docs/worklog/2026-04-28-slug.md` | Occasional logging (< 20 entries) |
| `year` | `docs/worklog/2026/2026-04-28-slug.md` | Moderate logging (default) |
| `year-month` | `docs/worklog/2026/04/2026-04-28-slug.md` | Daily logging |
